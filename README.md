🚀 Azure Function with Azure SQL Database Integration  

Overview**  
This project demonstrates how to **build a serverless Azure Function in C#** that connects to an **Azure SQL Database** to retrieve and return data in **JSON format**. The function is **triggered via an HTTP request**, making it a lightweight, scalable API solution for applications that need quick access to database records without deploying a full backend service.  
🔹 Features & Functionality**  

✅ **Serverless Execution** – Runs on-demand with no need for dedicated infrastructure.  
✅ **Azure SQL Database Connectivity** – Retrieves real-time data from a cloud-based relational database.  
✅ **HTTP Trigger** – Responds to GET requests to return JSON-formatted data.  
✅ **Scalable & Cost-Efficient** – Auto-scales based on request volume, reducing operational costs.  
✅ **Secure Authentication** – Uses **Azure Managed Identity or Connection Strings** for database access.  
✅ **Optimized Performance** – Supports **connection pooling** and **async database queries** for fast responses.  

### **🛠️ Tech Stack**  

- **C# (.NET 6/7/8)** – Backend logic for Azure Function.  
- **Azure Functions** – Serverless execution environment.  
- **Azure SQL Database** – Cloud-hosted relational database.  
- **Entity Framework Core / ADO.NET** – ORM or direct SQL query execution.  
- Azure API Management (Optional)** – Secures and manages API access.  
- Postman / Curl** – Testing API responses.  

🌐 Use Cases  

🔹 REST API for Data Retrieval** – Expose database records as an API for frontend applications.  
🔹 Automated Data Processing** – Run queries and return insights on demand.  
🔹 Event-Driven Architecture** – Extend the function to trigger on database changes, queues, or events.  
Cloud-Native Applications** – Integrate with other **Azure services** like **Logic Apps, Power BI, and AI services**.  

🚀 Project Workflow**  

1️⃣ HTTP Request Trigger:** A client (web app, mobile app, or API consumer) sends a request.  
2️⃣ Azure Function Execution:** The function processes the request and connects to Azure SQL.  
3️⃣ Database Query Execution:** The function retrieves records from the SQL database.  
4️⃣ JSON Response:** The results are formatted and returned as a JSON response.  
5️⃣ Scalability & Monitoring:** Azure automatically scales based on demand and logs function executions.
